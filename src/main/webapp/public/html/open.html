        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <p>This view allows you to choose one or more data tables to work with and anonymyztion method. To complete this
            step, do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose the table(s) which you would like to anonymize. You can select table by checking the checkbox in
                front of table name.
                <ul>
                    <li>Once you select the table you will immediately see the preview of this table under <code>Preview
                        of selected tables</code>. This will give you an idea of how table looks like.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Choose the anonymization method.
                <ul>
                    <li>Please note that when you select more than one table, only <code>MultiRelational
                        k-anonymity</code> is available. This limitation is due to fact that other other anonymization
                        methods would either offer insufficient protection to privacy or they would over generalize the
                        data,
                        making it useless for data miners.

        <h3>About different anonymization methods.</h3>
        <p>In this dialog you will be asked to choose anonymization method. Each method work a little bit differently
            and has a different purpose. This paragraph will give you brief overview of these methods.</p>
        <h4>k-Anonymity</h4>
        <p>The purpose of k-Anonymity is to protect individuals against record linkage attacks by anonymizing attribues
            in QID. The point of k-Anonymity is generalize data in QID columns to that for each row with some QID values
            there would be at least k-1 other rows with that same QID. k-Anonymity works in situations where each person
            is present only in one row. For example if <code>QID = {Age, Gender, City}</code> then the table below is
            2-Anonymous because the smallest QID group has size of 2.</p>

        <h4>(X, Y)-Anonymity (Currently unsupported)</h4>
        <p>The purpose of (X, Y)-Anonymity is to protect individuals against record linkage attacks. In cases where one
            individual appears in multiple rows k-Anonymity would not offer sufficient protection. For example if
            hospital releases data about diaseses, person who has multiple diaseses would be present in pultiple rows
            (one row per diasese). For example, if each person has 3 different diaseses it means that there are 3 rows
            for each person and therefore QID group of size k would only offer anonymity of k/3 instead of k. The
            following table is illustration of this.</p>

        <p>This table above would be 2-Anonymous on <code>QID = {Age, Gender, Elva}</code> but in reality in first QID
            group all 3 rows represent the same person who has 3 diaseses and in second group both 2 rows represent the
            same person who has two diaseses. (X, Y)-Anonymity overcomes this problem by making requirement that each
            element from group X has at least k elements from group Y. For example: require that each QID group
            represents at least k different persons.</p>
        <h4>MultiRelational k-anonymity</h4>
        <p>MultiRelational k-anonymity is also for protecting against record linkage. In more realistic situations, data is stored in relational database rather than one single table that contains all the data. Usually, it would be a person specific table (PT) and one table T for each sensitive
            attribute. In such situations other anonymization methods would either not provide sufficient protection for privacy or they could make data useless for dataminers by over generalizing it. Such tables have common identifier which can be used to link persons with their attributes. For
            example <code>PT = {Id, Name, Age, Gender, City}</code> and <code>T1= {PersonId, Job}</code>. In tabe T1 <code>PersonId</code> matches <code>Id</code> in PT so these table can be joined on <code>PT.Id = T1.PersonId</code> which would result in <code>T = {Id, Name, Age, Gender, City, Job}</code>. After joining those tables together into table T, k-Anonymity is applied to T.</p>
